# My_Portfolio
Hello there! Bogdan is here!

I'm a beginner front-end developer, Right now I can create a full web page with bunch of dynamics and animations (of course by using JavaScript - there's no way (Well you can use CSS3 in some places and I know them, but sometimes only JS will help you))

My knowledge and skills are:

- Russian Language (Because I'm a native Russian speaker)
- High level of English (Of course - it's like air for human but in IT)
- Knowledge of how to google everything (You got the idea, yup?)

- Grid CSS3
- Flex-Box CSS3
- Old style Float in CSS (Which help you with making a site for Internet Explorer)
- Semantic HTML5 (You know that it's required nowadays)

- Adaptivity of a web page
- Responsibility of it
- JavaScript (Because it's needed for a lot of things)

also my other skills are:

- Python 3.7 Core
- Java 13 Core
